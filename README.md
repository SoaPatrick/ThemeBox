ThemeBox
=========

Hi. I'm a starter theme called `ThemeBox`.

Getting Started
---------------

The first thing you want to do is copy the `themebox` directory and change the name to something else (like, say, `theme-one`), and then you'll need to do a three-step find and replace on the name in all the templates.

1. Search for: `'themebox'` and replace with: `'theme-one'`.
2. Rename `themebox.pot` from `languages` folder to use the theme's slug
3. Update or delete this readme.

Now you're ready to go! The next step is easy to say, but harder to do: make an awesome WordPress theme. :)

Good luck!
